# Conditional Statements in Python: Even or Odd Checker

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the given number is **even** or **odd** using `if...else` statements.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get an input from the user.
2. Convert the input to an integer and store it in a variable `a`.
3. Use the modulo operator `%` to check if `a % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, print `"EVEN"`.
   - Else, print `"ODD"`.
4. End the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```

a = int(input())
if a % 2 == 0:
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")
```

# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.
5. Print the real part of `x` using `x.real`.
6. Print the imaginary part of `x` using `x.imag`.

## ðŸ’» Program
~~~
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
x=complex(a,b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
~~~

# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~
men_stepped_on_the_moon= input()
print  (men_stepped_on_the_moon)
~~~
## Output
